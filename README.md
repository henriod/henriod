### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Odhiambo,

As a Software Engineer with a specialized background in Geospatial Technologies, I excel in developing location-aware applications for both web and mobile ecosystems. My core competencies extend from data visualization and interactive mapping to land administration systemsâ€”particularly those within the Cadastre domain. Beyond geospatial applications, my skills are deeply rooted in the broader landscape of software development.

Skills:
- Backend: Django (GeoDjango), FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Nodejs(Express)
- Frontend: Angular, Dart (Flutter)
- Mapping & Visualization: Leaflet, CesiumJS, PanoLensJS
- Database Management: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- DevOps: Docker, Bash Scripting, AWS, GCS, Linux

Current Status:
- ðŸŒ± I'm actively expanding my skill set by diving into Vue.js.
- ðŸ’¬ Currently engrossed in web applications that leverage spatial data for enhanced functionality.

I'm enthusiastic about delivering high-quality, scalable solutions and am always keen on embracing emerging technologies in the geospatial field. Feel free to connect!
