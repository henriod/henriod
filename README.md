### Hello 👋, I'm Odhiambo,

As a Software Engineer with an educational background in Geospatial Engineering, I thrive in developing location-aware applications for both web and mobile ecosystems with a major focus on the backend. My core competencies extend from database design, data analysis, API design, and interactive mapping to land administration systems. Beyond geospatial applications, my skills are also rooted in the broader landscape of software development.

Skills:
- Backend: Django (GeoDjango), FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Nodejs(Express)
- Frontend: Angular, Dart (Flutter)
- Mapping & Visualization: Leaflet, MapboxGL, GMaps, CesiumJS
- VirtualTours: ThreeJS, PanolensJS
- Database Management: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, DuckDB
- DevOps: Docker, Bash Scripting, AWS, GCS, Linux, VPS

Current Status:
- 🌱 I'm actively expanding my skill set by diving into Vue.js.
- 💬 Currently engrossed in web applications that leverage spatial data for enhanced functionality.

I'm enthusiastic about delivering high-quality, scalable solutions and am always keen on embracing emerging technologies in the geospatial field. Feel free to connect!
